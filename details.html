                        <h3>Clothes</h3>
                        <p><strong>First Semester:</strong> You arrive in summer and will also experience autumn and winter. Temperatures will range from 35° to 5° Celsius.
                            <strong>Second Semester:</strong> You will arrive during a very cold and wet winter, and experience both spring as well as some summer. Temperatures will range from 5° to 30° Celsius.
                            Pack a range of clothes that you can layer. Bear in mind that most houses in South Africa do not have air-conditioning. Hiking boots and a sleeping bag will be useful if you plan to travel. </p>

                        <p>Bring these with you. Pharmacies are plentiful and close by should you need over- the- counter medicine and prescription medication from a doctor here. <strong>Bring existing medication in its original container and for the duration of the semester as well as a letter from your doctor.</strong> Check the websites of your home universities for more detailed guidelines.</p>

                        <p><strong>Bring an old, cheap phone if you have one as well as your current phone. As long as you can make and receive calls, have whatsapp and the Uber app, it’s less likely to be stolen.</strong> Laptops, phones, cameras. Adaptors can be purchased at duty free shops in airports and in shops in Cape Town.<strong>Your landlords do not provide insurance for loss of personal items like a phones, laptops and cameras.</strong> It would be wise to see that these items are covered by an insurance through your home university or by a personal policy should these be lost or stolen.</p> <br>

                        <h3>Advice From Students</h3><br>
                        <blockquote>My advice to others is to engage heavily with the content of your classes and manage your time well. Travel, talk to new people, discuss important things and listen to different ideas. Befriend fellow South African students and international classmates. Don’t stay with cliques from your home country or home university. Keep an open mind and relish being out of your comfort zone now and again. In a word, my Cape Town experience was mind-blowing. - <strong>Brycen Ullrich (UCB June ’18)</strong></blockquote>
                        <br><br><br>
                        <blockquote>Isabel suggested students should try and read up on the history and current affairs of South Africa before they arrive. She read the autobiography of Nelson Mandela but if that is daunting as a huge read, there is plenty of other literature. She also did a basic Xhosa language course while in Cape Town and highly recommends this as a means of communicating more widely with a range of people both at UCT as well as in Cape Town despite most people being able to speak English here. - <strong>Isabel James ( Princeton June ’18)</strong></blockquote>

                <h2>On Arrival in Cape Town – step-by-step guide </h2>
                <p>You will be sent an Uber voucher from UCT IAPO office to get you from the airport to your accommodation. There should be UCT Orientation mentors at the airport to assist you with this during work hours. <br> <br>

                <h2>Accommodation</h2>
                <p> A priority for IDACA is the well-being and comfort of students while they are Cape Town. To this end, a good network of houses and landlords ensures accommodation of a very high standard. The houses are comfortable, secure and well maintained. All are located within walking distance of UCT’s main campus and are close to shops, restaurants, banks and transport. IDACA also works closely with UCT’s student housing administrators as some semester abroad students prefer to live in UCT student residences.<br><br>

                    Accommodation offered by IDACA includes single rooms as well as double, shared rooms. All housing offers wi-fi, well- equipped kitchens, shared bathrooms, living rooms and very often, an outdoor living area. The students, landlords and IDACA liaise closely to ensure that the houses are well functioning and secure at all times.<br><br>

                    The IDACA housing application form ( which you receive from your home university or college) provides housing details and as far as possible, makes every effort to accommodate students in the houses of their choice. Housing is confirmed before students leave the US.</p>

                <h2>History of IDACA</h2><br>
                <p>During the early 90s, Ida Cooper had been working in UCT’s Department of Public Affairs and Communications. With the increasing international interest in South Africa and its move from apartheid to the democratic elections in 1994, UCT became a hub for visiting students and academics.<br><br>

                    Ida Cooper’s knowledge of UCT and Cape Town, her experience of working closely with international visitors and her commitment to and engagement with the process of change in South Africa, led to a request for her to establish a support network for visiting students from the United States. Her earliest formal collaboration with a group of students from the U.S. was with Princeton.<br><br>

                    By 1995, Ida had established her highly personalized and efficient IDACA student support service with close ties to UCT, her partners in the United States, UCT’s IAPO, established in 1995 and the Student Study Abroad program formally launched in 1998.</p>

                <h3>Full circle Princeton \ UCT exchange program 1995</h3>
                <p>
                    In December 2015, twenty years after her study abroad semester at UCT, Nina Henning visited Cape Town and Ida Cooper, with her husband Lobsang and their baby daughter Tenzin. With her, as a gift for Ida, was a Yak Milk soap from Wild Earth Nepal, the small herbal cosmetics company in Kathmandu that Nina managed for five years after graduating from Princeton.<br><br>

                    “Coming from Princeton in the 90s to UCT and Cape Town was a life-changing experience for me. It opened my eyes to the world beyond Princeton, New Jersey, gave me new perspectives and was a catalyst for future international travel and work opportunities.”<br><br>

                    “Ida was like a surrogate mother to me as a twenty- year-old student in Cape Town. I stayed at her house for several weeks after my courses ended and my accommodation lease expired.”

                    <br><br>
                    In 1995, Nina, a history major at Princeton, was one of the first students to participate in the newly formed exchange programme between UCT and Princeton. She cites Professor Robert Shell, professor of African History at Princeton and a South African, as one of the key influences in her decision to study at UCT. He encouraged her to apply for the new programme in post-apartheid South Africa, with its first democratic election in 1994 and momentous political change. She recalled a vibrant campus life with addresses by the likes of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Winnie Mandela.

                    In 1995, Nina, a history major at Princeton, was one of the first students to participate in the newly formed exchange programme between UCT and Princeton. She cites Professor Robert Shell, professor of African History at Princeton and a South African, as one of the key influences in her decision to study at UCT. He encouraged her to apply for the new programme in post-apartheid South Africa, with its first democratic election in 1994 and momentous political change. She recalled a vibrant campus life with addresses by the likes of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Winnie Mandela.

                    Nina currently works for an US multinational company and lives in Nairobi, Kenya with her family. She leads regional projects at the intersection of philanthropy and business, including an initiative in Rwanda that is focused on improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who grow pyrethrum, a flower that contains a natural insecticide.
